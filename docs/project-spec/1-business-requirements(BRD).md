# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## 1. Project Overview
The ChatAI Platform aims to provide an intelligent conversational system with modular AI agents that can be extended for multiple domains (healthcare, finance, education, etc.).  
The platform will allow integration with external AI models (e.g., GPT, Grok, DeepSeek), as well as locally deployed models, to provide a hybrid and cost-effective AI solution.  

---

## 2. Business Objectives
- Provide a scalable AI assistant platform that can serve multiple industries.  
- Reduce development and integration costs by offering a modular, reusable AI ecosystem.  
- Ensure high availability, security, and compliance with international data protection regulations.  
- Support multi-language interactions (English, Vietnamese, Chinese).  
- Create a foundation for future AI-driven business opportunities (custom bots, SaaS model, API marketplace).

## 3. Scope

### 3.1 In Scope
- Development of a multi-agent AI coordination system.  
- Integration with external AI APIs (GPT, Grok, DeepSeek).  
- Support for domain-specific agents (HealthBot, EcoBot, EduBot, etc.).  
- Web and mobile client interfaces.  
- Centralized logging, monitoring, and reporting.  

### 3.2 Out of Scope
- AI model pre-training from scratch (only fine-tuning and integration supported).  
- Hardware provisioning and on-prem deployment (only Docker/K8s-based installation).  
- UI/UX design for third-party integrations (only provide API endpoints).

---

## 4. Stakeholders
- **Product Owner (PO):** Defines vision and priorities.  
- **Project Manager (PM):** Oversees execution and delivery.  
- **Developers / AI Engineers:** Build and integrate AI models.  
- **Data Engineers:** Manage pipelines, storage, and ETL processes.  
- **Test Engineers:** Ensure product quality and reliability.  
- **End Users:** Interact with the AI assistant (B2C/B2B clients).  

---

## 5. Key Business Requirements
1. The system must support hybrid AI: both local and external API-based models.  
2. The system must allow dynamic routing of user queries to specialized agents.  
3. The platform must expose REST + WebSocket APIs for integration.  
4. Users must have role-based access control (Admin, Developer, User).  
5. Data logging must support >1 billion events/day with near real-time analytics.  
6. The system must comply with **GDPR** and **local data protection regulations**.  
7. The platform must support at least 10,000 concurrent users.  
8. Response time must be <2s for standard queries.  
9. Support for extensibility: new agents can be added without major refactoring.  

---

## 6. Success Metrics
- **Adoption Rate:** Number of businesses and end-users integrating the platform.  
- **Performance Metrics:** Latency <2s, uptime 99.9%.  
- **Scalability:** Handle >1B logs/day and 100k requests/minute.  
- **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT):** ≥ 90% positive feedback.  
- **Time-to-Market:** New agent deployment within 2 weeks.  

---

## 7. Risks & Assumptions

### Risks
- Dependence on third-party AI APIs (cost, availability, policy changes).  
- Data privacy concerns when handling sensitive information (healthcare, finance).  
- Scalability challenges with large concurrent traffic.  

### Assumptions
- Users have access to stable internet connections.  
- Initial deployments will be containerized (Docker/K8s).  
- Cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP/Azure) available for scaling.  

---

## 8. Constraints
- Budget limited to <$500k in initial development phase.  
- Team size capped at 10–15 members in the first 6 months.  
- Strict compliance with data regulations (GDPR, HIPAA if healthcare domain).  

---

## 9. Glossary
- **AI Agent:** Independent component responsible for a domain-specific task.  
- **Coordinator:** Meta-agent that routes queries to the right agent.  
- **Hybrid AI:** Combination of local deployed models + external APIs.  
- **ETL:** Extract, Transform, Load process for handling data pipelines.

- **Reviewed by:** Product Owner, Project Manager  
- **Approved by:** Stakeholders Committee
