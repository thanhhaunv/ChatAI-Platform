## üí° TIPS CHO TECH WRITERS

### **Writing User Manuals:**
- **Use active voice:** "Click the button" (not "The button should be clicked")
- **Be concise:** One idea per sentence, short paragraphs
- **Use examples:** Real scenarios, not abstract concepts
- **Add visuals:** Screenshot > 1000 words
- **Test it:** Follow your own guide (does it work?)

### **Taking Screenshots:**
- **Annotate:** Add arrows, numbers, highlights
- **Crop:** Focus on relevant area, remove clutter
- **Consistent style:** Same resolution, same annotations style
- **Update regularly:** Screenshots go stale fast
- **Alt text:** For accessibility (describe image)

### **Writing FAQ:**
- **User language:** What users ask, not technical jargon
- **Short answers:** <100 words, link to detailed guide if more info
- **Group by topic:** Easier to browse than alphabetical
- **Update constantly:** FAQ never "done"
- **Search-friendly:** Use keywords users might search

### **Video Tutorials:**
- **Plan script:** Don't wing it, write outline
- **Keep short:** 2-5 mins max (attention span)
- **Show, don't tell:** Screen recording > talking head
- **Add captions:** Accessibility, watching without sound
- **Professional tools:** Loom, Camtasia, or OBS Studio

### **Collaboration:**
- **Early drafts:** Share with team (get feedback before polishing)
- **Subject matter experts:** Interview devs, admins for accuracy
- **Beta users:** Test guides (do they understand?)
- **Iterate:** Documentation never perfect, keep improving

## üéØ CONTENT PRINCIPLES

### **For All Documentation:**
1. **User-centric:** Write for the reader, not the writer
2. **Actionable:** Tell users WHAT to do, not just concepts
3. **Accessible:** Simple language, avoid jargon (or explain it)
4. **Scannable:** Headers, bullets, bold keywords
5. **Up-to-date:** Review quarterly, update with changes
6. **Searchable:** Use keywords users might search
7. **Visual:** Screenshots, diagrams, videos
8. **Tested:** Follow your own instructions (does it work?)

### **Tone & Voice:**
- **Friendly:** Not robotic, but professional
- **Helpful:** "Here's how..." not "You should know..."
- **Encouraging:** "Great job!" after completing task
- **Honest:** If something's complex, acknowledge it
- **Respectful:** Don't assume user knowledge level

## üö® CRITICAL REMINDERS

**Before Publishing:**

**Avoid These Mistakes:**
- ‚ùå Outdated screenshots (users get confused)

- ‚ùå No visuals (text-only boring)
- ‚ùå Dead links (check quarterly)
- ‚ùå No search (users can't find answers)
- ‚ùå Ignoring feedback (users tell you what's unclear)
