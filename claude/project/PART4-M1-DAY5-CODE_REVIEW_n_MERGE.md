                                    ↓
                                conversations (2 records)

```

## Test Coverage
- Statements: 75%+
- Branches: 70%+
- Functions: 80%+
- Lines: 75%+

## Screenshots
*(Add screenshots if you have them)*
- CI/CD pipeline passing
- Swagger UI
- Database tables in pgAdmin

## Deployment Notes
No deployment required for this PR - database only.

**After merge:**
1. Run migrations: `pnpm run typeorm migration:run -d ormconfig.ts`
2. Seed database: `pnpm run seed`

## Breaking Changes
None - this is the initial database setup.

## Dependencies
No new external dependencies beyond:
- TypeORM (already planned)
- PostgreSQL 15
- bcrypt (for seed data)

## Performance Considerations
- All foreign keys indexed
- Frequently queried columns indexed
- JSONB used for flexible metadata
- Soft deletes (is_active flags)

## Security Considerations
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- API keys encrypted in config_json
- SQL injection prevented by TypeORM
- Unique constraints on email/phone

## Next Steps
After merge:
- M2: Auth Service implementation
- Build on these entities for authentication
- Add CRUD controllers in M3
